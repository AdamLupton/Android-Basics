# Android-Basics

This repo is designed for my own self learning and exploration of the basic concepts of android development.

Most likely this will mean basic applications and games built with android studio and designed for specific devices rather than enhanced dynamic formatting to accomodate many different applications.

Feel free to learn along with me if you stumble upon this repo.
